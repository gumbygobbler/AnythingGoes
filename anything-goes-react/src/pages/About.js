                Anything Goes was created by a group of friends who sought to
                combine creativity and entertainment. We are a group of
                undergraduate computer engineers who were looking to have some
                competitive fun.

                We have created a virtual arena where you can upload your
                favorite “fighters” (in the form of any image from your gallery)
                to brawl against users all around the web. As this entertainment
                happens in real-time, the users watching will decide the winners
                by votes on the match floor.{" "}
