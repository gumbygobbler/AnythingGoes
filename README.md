# AnythingGoes
Repo for a fun little website for people to brawl others with the things around them.

My idea is a website where people can take pictures of the things they own, or things or people around them, upload them on the website, and in real-time have 5-minute "battles" with pictures that other people upload to the website. The winner is decided by votes from people currently on the site.

It will consist of three pages: the welcome page, the fight page, a login page, a registration page, and an account page.
The welcome page will give a brief introduction to what the website does, as well as redirect people to the fight page and account pages.
The fight page is a place where guests and account users can vote for their "fighter".

The account page is for people who wish to upload "fighters". They will have to name their "fighters" and will get the results of the "fights" that they participate in once they complete. 
Account page will also list the number of wins for a given "fighter".

Previous "fighters" can also rematch.
